# Zaid Portofolio

## Overview
This is a mini website that I created as my portfolio while studying at the RevoU Bootcamp.  
This website contains the journey of my learning process at RevoU. It is not finished yet, as I just started a few weeks ago.

## Features
The main features of this portfolio website are:

1. **Home Page** — an introduction about myself.
2. **About Page** — a deeper introduction about me and some of my achievements.
3. **Project Page** — showcases the projects I am currently working on in the bootcamp.
4. **Contact Page** — allows people who are interested in collaboration or partnership to reach me.

**Other additional features:**

- External navigation links to my social profiles for collaboration and networking.
- Some photos to show my profile and a bit of my photography portfolio.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used as the main structure of the website. I use semantic elements for better accessibility.
- **CSS**: Used to style the website (only basic styles for now).
